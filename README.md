# ![Dashcards Favicon](favicon-32x32.png) What is Dashcards?



Dashcards is a free, open-source flashcard website created by Tejas Patel and Miguel Diaz, based on Tejas's [original C++ CLI program](https://github.com/tpate0562/Quizlet-main/blob/master/main.cpp). Our design philosophy, and the namesake of the website, is speed: the ability to study quickly and efficiently without being bogged down by page loads and animations.

# How to Use

To begin with a preset, simply select "From Preset" in the Load Deck dropdown menu and choose a deck. To load from a file, first create a deck in [Create Deck](https://tpate0562.github.io/Dashcards/createdeck.html) with a minimum of 5 terms. Once finished, download the deck and load it in on the homepage.

# A Note on Presets

Currently, the only presets available are the vocab lists for Mr. Coursey's AP English Language class, as this supported the purpose of the original program. If you would like a new preset to be added, please contact us or submit a pull request!
